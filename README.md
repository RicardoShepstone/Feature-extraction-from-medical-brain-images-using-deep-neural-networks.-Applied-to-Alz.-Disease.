This is my end of degree project.

Abstract:

The arrival of Deep Learning has meant a revolution in society, allowing 
complex problem solving thanks to the great capabilities that these 
algorithms offer on pattern recognition in huge amounts of data.
On another note, the advancements in the field of medical imaging have 
improved the diagnosis and research of certain pathologies which previously 
posed lot of questions.

In this work we look to combine the great advantages of Deep Learning for 
pattern recognition, with the priceless information granted by medical 
images, to build a tool that facilitates one of the main neurodegenerative 
diseases, Alzheimer’s disease.

Specifically, convolutional neural network structures will be used. These are 
structures that shine when applied to images (in two and three dimensions) 
are combined with supervised training algorithms to perform structural 
magnetic resonance image diagnosis and to classify the images accordingly.
In this work, we aim to introduce fundamental supervised learning concepts. 
All to ease the understanding of how the model Works.

Lastly, this model will be used to make predictions on a set of data whose 
results are known, in order to evaluate it. For the model’s evaluation, we will 
use certain measures used in classification problems, also we will use some 
techniques specialised in estimating the model’s generalizability.
